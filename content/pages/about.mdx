# Who am I

My name is Elliot Schoenfeld. I grew up in northern Florida, am one of 3 kids, and did the traditional / expected university track at the University of Florida. There I studied Computer Hardware Engineering and I subsequently got a job in Atlanta, Georgia at Norfolk Southern as a Software Engineer. My significant other Jenn moved up to Atlanta with me and we began building a family with our dog, Ollie. After working at NS for a bit I started a side hustle with my coworker and we started building software for small businesses in the Atlanta area. After a few years, I transitioned to a new role at Accenture where I specialized in rapid prototyping and becoming an expert in design thinking and innovation in tech. Here I also got experience running a team and learned a lot in my short time. I left after a year and a half and began a trip around the world vlogging with Jenn. I during this time I also started growing Ollieware LLC as a new consultancy. Mainly this was subsidizing our trip. So far we have vlogged 8 months of our journey and are imagining a new venture focused on urban design.
